## Project Overview  

This repository includes multiple tasks showcasing frontend development skills, focusing on React.js and its ecosystem.  

### Technology Choices and Rationale  
- **React.js**: Chosen for its component-based architecture, scalability, and community support.  
- **React Beautiful DnD**: Used in **Task 2** for drag-and-drop functionality to create intuitive interfaces.  
- **Form Builder Libraries**: Implemented in **Task 3** to efficiently handle dynamic forms.  
- **CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS**: For clean, maintainable, and responsive styling.  

### Known Limitations/Trade-offs  
- **Limited Features**: Some advanced features were deprioritized due to time constraints.  
- **Performance**: Optimization such as lazy-loading and memoization could further improve efficiency.  

### Future Improvements  
- Add **unit tests** with Jest for better code reliability.  
- Integrate **state management** with Redux or Context API for scalability.  
- Deploy the project using **Vercel** or **Netlify** for live production.
